# GitHub Copilot Instructions for this Repository

## Critical Rules

**ALWAYS CHECK THE REPOSITORY FIRST** before proposing any solution:

1. Read existing code, functions, and patterns in the repo
2. Search for similar implementations that already exist
3. Use existing helper functions and conventions
4. Only propose solutions after understanding what's already there

**DO NOT:**
- Suggest solutions without checking existing code first
- Ignore established patterns in the codebase
- Overcomplicate when simpler solutions exist in the repo
- Assume functionality doesn't exist - always verify

## Repository-specific Context

- This is a Snakemake workflow
- Check `workflow/rules/` for existing rules and helper functions
- Check `workflow/scripts/` for existing Python scripts
- Always verify function names and patterns before proposing new ones
